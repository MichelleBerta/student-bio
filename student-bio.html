          Fifty year old, mother of three. Happily married for twenty five
          years. My youngest graduaties college this year with a degree in
          classical piano performance. The middle daugther is a web developer.
          My oldest is studying to be an LPC and will also graduate in the
          spring.

          Since becoming an empty nester, I've discovered I love swing dancing
          and escape rooms. Providing entertainment opportunities is something I
          truly enjoy. I frequently host swing dance parties, life sized Clue
          event, and lip sync parties to name a few. I would love to open an
          escape room. Perhaps some day I can use the skills I'm learning to
          create an on-line escape game.
